# cryptoTicker
An iOS Cryptocurrency ticker app

# Why?
I know what your thinking, another cryptocurrency ticker? The iOS AppStore is already **flooded** with cryptocurrency wallets, tickers, and exchanges! Do we really need another one?

I admit, the idea of a cryptocurrency ticker isn't exactly "original", however there is one primary reason why I chose to build yet another one of these apps:

Being a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I've tried many different apps across the AppStore searching for one with a decent UI coupled with features you would expecting when tracking prices of an admitedly volatile currency. None of them quite met my expectations. Some provided an intuitive UI, however they lacked necessary features such as being able to recieve notifications whenever a currency droped below, or breached a certain price. Others were crammed full of helpful (and sometimes pointless) features all clamouring for the users attention; In cases like these, the UI was so cramped and counter-intuitive that just trying to find the price of Bitcoin (the most popular cryptocurrency available) required you to jump through several hoops. Having become fed up the how poorly built each of these apps were, I decided to do what any developer worth their salt would, build my own!
